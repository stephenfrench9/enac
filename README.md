# enac
An attempt to write code that will be useful for a neural affordance calculus. At the very least, a useful learning experiment for myself.

## Whats in a name: 
n is the number of wikipedia articles that the program downloads and examines. It is meant to be around 10.

## Usage: n_wiki_parser.py
Printed to the console: Each paragraph from the articles is printed alongside its parse.  
Printed to the console: The affordance distributions are printed at the conclusion of the script.  
Saved to a file: The paragraphs and parses are saved to "n_wiki_pages"  
Saved to a file: The affordance distribution is pickled and saved in "all_affordances.py"
